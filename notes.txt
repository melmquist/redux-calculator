Detailed expectations:

§  Create a from-scratch calculator app in a new GitHub repository

§  Use React for the front-end

§  You can make it look however you want.

§  Minimum functionality will include addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, equals, and memory storage (MS) & retrieval (MR)

§  Manage the application state and its transitions with Redux

§  Write unit tests to assert intended behavior using Jest

§  Upon completion, give us access to the GitHub repository so we can clone it; 
doing so is probably easiest if you make the repo public. Ultimately, we should 
be able to clone your repo locally then run npm start to use the app or npm test 
to run the unit tests.

§  Browser compatibility requirements: latest Chrsome, IE11, latest Firefox


Feel free to add any additional features as long as you make it clear that you're doing so. 
We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with. Good luck!





after RETREUVE puts val on eVALQUEUE, if a user adds a number, it should reset the 
evalQueue to that input number, and not just start prepending
    --> IF USER CLICKS NUMBER, CHECK LAST INPUT ON EVAL QUEUE length-1, if that is a number reset

if user is adding numbers, THEN CLICKS AN OPERATOR, THAT SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY PUSH THE 
VAL to the evalQueue 


-------
ELIMINATE THE VALUES DISPLAY
every time you add a number to value, push to eval queue but reset the last 
item there with the new one you have





ON OPERATOR HIT, (AFTER MEMORY RETREIVE)
values empty, 
EvalQueue filled with RETREIVE
IT RESETS THE EVALQUEUE WITH JUST THE OPERATOR AND DELETES THE RETREIVE on EQ



SUMMARY: 

input values get registered, evaluated and displayed using a cobination of 3 elements:
1) this.state.values (array on component level)
2) this.props.evalQueue (array on redux store with methods/access through container)
3) this.props.result (string on redux store with methods/access through container)

The Calculator component takes button inputs and categorizes them based on their IDs
