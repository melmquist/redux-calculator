Detailed expectations:

§  Create a from-scratch calculator app in a new GitHub repository

§  Use React for the front-end

§  You can make it look however you want.

§  Minimum functionality will include addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, equals, and memory storage (MS) & retrieval (MR)

§  Manage the application state and its transitions with Redux

§  Write unit tests to assert intended behavior using Jest

§  Upon completion, give us access to the GitHub repository so we can clone it; 
doing so is probably easiest if you make the repo public. Ultimately, we should 
be able to clone your repo locally then run npm start to use the app or npm test 
to run the unit tests.

§  Browser compatibility requirements: latest Chrsome, IE11, latest Firefox


Feel free to add any additional features as long as you make it clear that you're doing so. 
We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with. Good luck!
